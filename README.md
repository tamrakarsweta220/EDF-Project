# EDF-Project

In this project, if you run the server.js file using the command `node server.js`, it will load an html page in `localhost:3000` where the user can provide some input about the hazard. Once the user types in all necessary information, they can hit the "AddTOMongoDB" button at the end of the page. This action will transfer the data from the html page to the mongodb atlas (database: winterCycleDB, collection: reports).<br/>
However, if you only want to run the flask project (the version that is not connected to mongodb but takes in input from the user and displays it in the form of another webpage, go to the form.html file, to line 10, and change the code from `<form action="/" method="POST">` to `<form action="/insert" method="POST">`. Once you modify this code, you can go to the folder in your terminal and type in `flask run` to run the flask project.
